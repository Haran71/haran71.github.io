## About Me

I'm an incoming CS PhD Student at UT Austin, and will be working with <a href="https://www.philkr.net">Philipp Kr√§henb√ºhl</a>.

## Research Interests

My work during my undergrad was at the intersection of vision and language with a specific focus on Video Understanding.

I'm entering my PhD with a clean slate looking to explore Deep Learning and Computer Vision more deeplyüòä.
